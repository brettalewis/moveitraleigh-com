Move It Raleigh is launching into its first year with a benefit concert on December 2nd that will showcase local performing artists in the Triangle area.

To support the benefit concert, a volunteer-based group from CC&CO will lead a sponsorship and donation (auction) campaign to host the concert with remaining proceeds to be split between dance studios impacted by Hurricane Florence and Helping Hands.

Our goal is to net $10,000, with $5,000 going to benefit Helping Hands!

All donations will be made to Move It Raleigh and then will be dispersed accordingly.
