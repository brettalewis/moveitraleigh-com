Welcome MOVERS! Move It Raleigh is so excited to announce its SECOND ever community collaboration piece for Raleigh Gives Back 2020 on January 26th! Our mission is to unite dancers in the Triangle dance community and provide a performance opportunity for our local dancers to dance together for one special night! This piece is super exciting as it will be the closing number for this year's benefit concert!! Due to the different schedules that everyone has, we will only hold one staging rehearsal on January 24th at CC & Co Dance Complex from 4:00 - 5:30pm. That being said you will learn the choreography via a video link which will be sent to you once you have paid your participation/donation fee of $10-$20 at your discretion. SIGN UP CLOSES ON JANUARY 17TH 2020!! You will pay via Venmo: @MoveIt-Raleigh. Please note you must be available for rehearsal on January 24th as well as for the concert January 26th at 6:30pm. We hope you can join the fun and look forward to MOVING with you all!! Please email <a href="mailto:moveitraleigh@gmail.com">moveitraleigh@gmail.com</a> with any questions!
