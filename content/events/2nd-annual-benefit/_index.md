**Raleigh Gives Back.**

We would like to extend a big thank you to our audience, supporters, and sponsors for YOUR part in making MOVE IT RALEIGH’S 2nd annual benefit concert “Raleigh Gives Back” a night full of community, love, and collaboration! We are completely honored & humbled by the support and generosity given by our community! 

This year, we had 16 studios and performers grace the stage. Our very first community collaboration performance opportunities brought together dancers from different studios that would not usually have the chance to dance with one another. We are extremely grateful to Grace Buckley for choreographing our first ever collaboration piece, bringing 20 dancers from 5 different studios together for one special night. We would also like to thank each one of the nearly 100 dancers who participated in our closing number - our second collaboration opportunity. We were able to raise close to $900 from this incredible experience! We are so proud of these dancers who had to learn choreography off of a video and only had ONE rehearsal!!! Seeing dancers from all over the Triangle gave us chills - and we cannot wait until next year! It was truly moving to see you ALL light up the stage with your pure, genuine love for dance!

We would also love to announce that we raised almost $20,000 in donations this year! Portions of these proceeds will fund our first community dance workshop Raleigh Moves Together!! Raleigh Moves Together is a FREE workshop to be held on March 14th, 2020 at CC & Co. Dance Complex for dancers that are enrolled in middle and high school dance programs in Wake County to provide access to classes with professional educators and choreographers. Interested schools and/or dancers can find more details under our “Community” tab.

Thank you for making Move It Raleigh a success, and be on the lookout in late spring for the date of next year’s RALEIGH GIVES BACK!
