## Special Performance Opportunity (8th grade-high school)

**Collaborative Community Dance with Choreographer Grace Buckley for the Raleigh Gives Back Performance.**

We are excited to announce that Grace Buckley will be setting a special piece of choreography featuring talented dancers from Triangle area dance studios and school programs. Interested dancers must take the master class on December 18 and stay from 6:00-6:15 for a brief audition. Dancers cast in the piece will be emailed on the evening of December 18. A participation donation fee between $50-$75 would be appreciated. Rehearsals will be held on Thursday, December 19 from approx. 4:00-6:00 and Friday, December 20 from approx. 4:00-8:00. This piece will perform in the Move It Raleigh benefit show on the evening of Sunday, January 26 so dancers must be available on this date. Dancers do not need to be in an additional school or studio piece to perform in this collaborative piece.
