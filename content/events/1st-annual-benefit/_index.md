**Join The Journey. Be A Part Of The Evolution. Make A Difference.**

The First Annual Move It Raleigh Benefit Concert will be held December 2nd at Rolesville High School. Experience a two-hour community performance showcasing amazingly talented local performing artists. This can't-miss event will be filled with dance, music and song. Come and enjoy **ART IN MOTION**.

Move It Raleigh is launching into its first year with a benefit concert on December 2nd that will showcase local performing artists in the Triangle area.

To support the benefit concert, a volunteer-based group from CC&CO will lead a sponsorship and donation (auction) campaign to host the concert with remaining proceeds to be split between dance studios impacted by Hurricane Florence and Helping Hand Mission of Raleigh.

Our goal is to net $10,000, with $5,000 going to benefit Helping Hand Mission of Raleigh!

Proceeds to benefit [Helping Hand Mission of Raleigh](http://helpinghandmission.org/) and dance studios impacted by Hurricane Florence.

All donations will be made to Move It Raleigh and then will be dispersed accordingly.
